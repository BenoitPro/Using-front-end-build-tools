# Introduction

This book is aimed at designers who also do front end development. These days, it seems that we all wear multiple hats in our jobs!

Since the turn of the century, web development has become far more sophisticated. This has led to more complexity, and many of us are finding we have to work with many new things. This can seem a little intimidating (I have certainly found myself wishing that the pace of progress would slow down!).

To take advantage of this sophistication whilst reducing its complexity, front-end developers use build tools. These tools allow us to work at a higher level and automate away repetitive tasks, thereby saving time and producing more sophisticated results. Automation streamlines our processes so that we can focus on creative work, rather than spending hours lost in the weeds of tedious tasks.

In this short book, we will go through some of the build tools that are available, what they can do for you, and how you can get started with them. I will refer to some specific tools, but this book will not teach you the specifics of a particular build tool; after all, each build tool is well documented online and in print already. Instead, this book functions as a primer on what build tools are and how to assemble powerful, efficient build workflows with them.

The goal of this book is that, once you have read it, you will be able to improve your workflow by incorporating build tools. I aim to give you the confidence and knowledge needed to dive into this world of powerful and flexible utilities, become more productive, and enjoy your work more as a result.

# Let’s talk about workflow

Workflow is the set of tasks that one goes through when doing a job. Everyone’s workflow is different, and you might have multiple workflows for different aspects of your role. We will look at web development workflow and how to optimise it.

## Basic web development workflow

In developing websites and applications, you probably have phases that look something like this:
